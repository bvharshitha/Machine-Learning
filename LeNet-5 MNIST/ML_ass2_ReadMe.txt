#LeNet-5 MNIST PyTorch Implementation

This project demonstrates a handwritten digit recognition model using the LeNet-5 architecture on the MNIST dataset. The model is built and trained in Google Colab, and the dataset is loaded through libraries without needing manual upload. This project includes loading the dataset, training the model, evaluating its performance, and generating a prediction for a custom input image.

1. Open Google Colab:
        Go to Google Colab and upload the ml_ass2.ipynb notebook file.
2. Setup and Requirements:
        No additional dataset upload is required; the MNIST dataset will load automatically using PyTorchâ€™s libraries.
        Ensure these libraries are imported in the Colab environment:
        torch (for model creation and training)
        torchvision (for datasets and transformations)
        PIL (for image handling)
3. Upload Prediction Image:
        If you wish to test a custom prediction image, upload it in .png format and replace the image path in the code where
        required.
4. Run the Notebook:
        The cells will load the dataset, define and train the model, evaluate it, and display metrics.
